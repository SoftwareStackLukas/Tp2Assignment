#General
- The following tests have to be executed:
	- VehicleTest, RoadTest, CirtRoadTest, InterCityRoadTest,
	- JunctionTest, MostCrowdedStrategyTest, RoundRobinStrategyTest,
	- MoveFirstStrategyTest, MoveAllStrategyTest.
	
#Errors
- advance() method in vehicles --> Should be fixed but in Road are problems
- Check in Road the method <b> void advance(int time) </b>
- Change the accessors in the Road classes from package private to private. The access should just be possible via the setter/getter
